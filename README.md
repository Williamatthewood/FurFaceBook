# FurFaceBook


## This application was built with animal lovers in mind. It's a place where enthusiasts of all types
of animals can connect and find out about, or discuss events, services, or issues regarding the local animal community. 

The motivation for building this application was to give people an easily accessible site
that deals specifically with animals, and make it community specific. We're also a group of 
animal lovers and see the value of such a resource. 

We built this project as a way of streamlining the process of finding out about animal and pet related issues
in a certain community. 

This application makes finding things animal and pet related much easier. Maybe someone needs a vet that
makes housecalls, or has farm animals that not every vet will see. It could help someone find a dog walker
in the community that people know and trust, or possibly a dog sitter that stay in their home while
on vacation. They could see referrals for these services and have a sense of peace that their furry, 
feathered, hairy, or scaled friend was in good hands.

This project allowed us to learn more about collaboration, our strengths and weaknesses, as well as
having to research new programs for use that we need to implement, even if we're not familiar with it.
